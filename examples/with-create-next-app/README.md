## Nuz + Netx.js (with-typescript)

The template is [with-typescript](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript) created by [creact-next-app](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

### What is different?

**1.** Installed @nuz/core as `dependencies` and @nuz/cli as `devDependencies`.
**2.** Add script `dev-workspace` in package.json.
**3.** A new folder named `workspace` includes `modules` created by [@nuz/cli](https://github.com/lamhieu-vk/nuz/tree/master/packages/nuz-cli).
**4.** File `pages/_app.tsx` default of next with some config for [@nuz/core](https://github.com/lamhieu-vk/nuz/tree/master/packages/nuz-core).
**5.** Updated `next.config.js` file to use helper of CORE for [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), support **server-side-rendering**.
**6.** Updated `pages/index.tsx` file to use [@nuz/core](https://github.com/lamhieu-vk/nuz/tree/master/packages/nuz-core).

### Run it!?

You just run 2 scripts below:

#### Start dev mode of `next.js`:
```sh
# with npm
$ npm run dev

# or yarn
$ yarn dev
```

#### Start workspace mode of `@nuz/core`:
```sh
# with npm
$ npm run dev-workspace

# or yarn
$ yarn dev-workspace
```

### Good luck! üëç
